## Data Pipeline & Methodology

#### 1️. Data Extraction

#### 2️. Data Cleaning & Transformation
**Key Operations:**
-  Removed duplicate records (0.3% of dataset)
-  Handled missing values using domain-appropriate methods
-  Standardized date formats and time zones
-  Geocoded locations for spatial analysis
-  Created categorical hierarchies (crime type → category → severity)
-  Engineered temporal features (hour, day of week, month, season, year)


#### 3️. Data Modeling (Star Schema)

**Fact Table**: `fact_crimes`
- Primary keys: CrimeID, DateKey, LocationKey, TypeKey
- Measures: CrimeCount, ArrestCount, DomesticCount

**Dimension Tables**:
- `dim_date`: Date, Year, Quarter, Month, Week, Day, Hour
- `dim_location`: District, Beat, Ward, Community Area, Coordinates
- `dim_crime_type`: Type, Category, FBI Code, Severity
- `dim_arrest`: Arrest Status, Resolution Time

**Relationships**: One-to-Many from dimensions to fact table

#### 4️. Advanced DAX Measures

```dax
-- Total Crimes
Total Crimes = COUNTROWS(fact_crimes)

-- Arrest Rate
Arrest Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(fact_crimes), fact_crimes[Arrest] = TRUE()),
    COUNTROWS(fact_crimes),
    0
) * 100

-- Year-over-Year Change
YoY Change = 
VAR CurrentYearCrimes = [Total Crimes]
VAR PreviousYearCrimes = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Crimes],
        DATEADD(dim_date[Date], -1, YEAR)
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE(
    CurrentYearCrimes - PreviousYearCrimes,
    PreviousYearCrimes,
    0
) * 100

-- Crime Density (crimes per 1000 residents)
Crime Density = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Crimes],
    SUM(dim_location[Population]) / 1000,
    0
)

-- Moving Average (30 days)
30-Day MA = 
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(
        dim_date[Date],
        LASTDATE(dim_date[Date]),
        -30,
        DAY
    ),
    [Total Crimes]
)
```
